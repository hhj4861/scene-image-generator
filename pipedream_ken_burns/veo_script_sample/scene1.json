  "prompt": "8K cinematic interview video. Use the provided reference image as the exact visual base for the entire 8 seconds. A golden-brown fluffy Pomeranian wearing orange pumpkin costume with jack-o-lantern face design and green stem hat sits facing camera. Halloween photo booth background with orange, black, brown, gold, green balloon arch. White backdrop. Black spider web floor mat. Small white ghost decorations. Warm festive lighting. The dog appearance must stay identical to reference image from 0:00 to 0:08. When dog speaks from 4-8 seconds, keep the same dog face, same fur color, same costume, same green stem hat, same background. Only add subtle mouth opening and closing movements for lip sync. Do not regenerate or change the dog image when speech begins. Maintain visual continuity throughout. No text overlays. No subtitles. No captions. No watermarks.",
